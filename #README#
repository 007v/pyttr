This is the beginnings of a TTR implementation in Python 3.4.3.  Run
the examples in the files example-records.py and example-types.py

This implementation covers a core of TTR, including:
     Basic types
     Ptypes (types constructed with predicates and their arguments)
     Meet (intersection) types
     Join (union) types
     Function types
     List types
     Record types
     String types
     Judging (assigning objects to types)
     Querying (asking whether an object of a type)
     Adding witness conditions to types
     Creating objects of types
     Subtyping
     Type merging (including asymmetric type merging)
     Possibilities (type may have different witnesses in different
     		   possibilities)
